% We propose Internet Explorer, an unsupervised system that autonomously collects image data from the Internet in order to improve performance on a target visual task. Internet Explorer performs self-supervised learning on relevant images it adaptively finds with Google Image Search. This enables it to match or surpass the performance of models trained for much longer on much more data. 
% This relies on a nearest-neighbors curiosity reward that encourages new images to be close to the target dataset images in representation space. Internet Explorer also uses text similarity to predict how unseen queries will perform. We show that this is an efficient training method that can approach or even surpass the performance of models trained for much longer and on much more data. 
% There are quite a few avenues for future work. 
% While the nearest neighbors reward works well empirically, there likely exists better metrics that quantify how useful a particular image is. Other types of self-supervised learning algorithms, such as Masked Autoencoder~\cite{he2022masked}, may be a better fit for degenerate Internet images. Finally, Internet videos could be a richer source of data to explore. \\

We show that interactively exploring the Internet is an efficient source of highly relevant training data---if one knows how to search for it. In just 30--40 hours of training on a single GPU, Internet Explorer either significantly outperforms or closely matches the performance of compute-heavy \textit{oracle} models like CLIP~\cite{radford2021learning} trained on static datasets, as well as strong baselines that search the Internet in an undirected manner.

% What’s next on the open web?
% ● Scale to larger / more diverse datasets like ImageNet
% ● Apply to more challenging vision tasks, videos, and robotics
% ● Finetune a CLIP model online using captions + search terms!
