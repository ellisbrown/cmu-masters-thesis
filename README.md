+ This repository started from
  [Brandon Amos](http://bamos.github.io)'s great [thesis repo](https://github.com/bamos/thesis),
  which was based on [Cyrus Omar's thesis code](https://github.com/cyrus-/thesis),
  which, in turn, was based on a CMU thesis template
  by [David Koes](http://bits.csb.pitt.edu/)
  and others before.
