This article describes GigaSight, an Internet-scale repository of crowd-sourced video content, with strong enforcement of privacy preferences and access controls. The GigaSight architecture is a federated system of VM-based cloudlets that perform video analytics at the edge of the Internet, thus reducing the demand for ingress bandwidth into the cloud. Denaturing, which is an owner-specific reduction in fidelity of video content to preserve privacy, is one form of analytics on cloudlets. Content-based indexing for search is another form of cloudlet-based analytics. This article is part of a special issue on smart spaces.},

  abstract  = {We consider the setting of an agent with a fixed body interacting with an unknown and uncertain external world. We show that models trained to predict proprioceptive information about the agent's body come to represent objects in the external world. In spite of being trained with only internally available signals, these dynamic body models come to represent external objects through the necessity of predicting their effects on the agent's own body. That is, the model learns holistic persistent representations of objects in the world, even though the only training signals are body signals. Our dynamics model is able to successfully predict distributions over 132 sensor readings over 100 steps into the future and we demonstrate that even when the body is no longer in contact with an object, the latent variables of the dynamics model continue to represent its shape. We show that active data collection by maximizing the entropy of predictions about the body---touch sensors, proprioception and vestibular information---leads to learning of dynamic models that show superior performance when used for control. We also collect data from a real robotic hand and show that the same models can be used to answer questions about properties of objects in the real world. Videos with qualitative results of our models are available <a href="https://goo.gl/mZuqAV">here</a>.},

We then reflect on the difficulties we faced in building these applications, and suggest future research that could simplify the creation of similar applications.},

  abstract  = {Unease over data privacy will retard consumer acceptance of IoT deployments. The primary source of discomfort is a lack of user control over raw data that is streamed directly from sensors to the cloud. This is a direct consequence of the over-centralization of today\textquoteright{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}s cloud-based IoT hub designs. We propose a solution that interposes a locally-controlled software component called a privacy mediator on every raw sensor stream. Each mediator is in the same administrative domain as the sensors whose data is being collected, and dynamically enforces the current privacy policies of the owners of the sensors or mobile users within the domain. This solution necessitates a logical point of presence for mediators within the administrative boundaries of each organization. Such points of presence are provided by cloudlets, which are small locally-administered data centers at the edge of the Internet that can support code mobility. The use of cloudlet-based mediators aligns well with natural personal and organizational boundaries of trust and responsibility.},

  abstract  = {As machine learning techniques have become more ubiquitous, it has become common to see machine learning prediction algorithms operating within some larger process. However, the criteria by which we train machine learning algorithms often differ from the ultimate criteria on which we evaluate them. This paper proposes an end-to-end approach for learning probabilistic machine learning models within the context of stochastic programming, in a manner that directly captures the ultimate task-based objective for which they will be used. We then present two experimental evaluations of the proposed approach, one as applied to a generic inventory stock problem and the second to a real-world electrical grid scheduling task. In both cases, we show that the proposed approach can outperform both a traditional modeling approach and a purely black-box policy optimization approach.},

Existing parameter learning approaches for SPNs are largely based on the maximum likelihood principle and hence are subject to overfitting compared to more Bayesian approaches. Exact Bayesian posterior inference for SPNs is computationally intractable. Both standard variational inference and posterior sampling for SPNs are computationally infeasible even for networks of moderate size due to the large number of local latent variables per instance. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic collapsed variational inference algorithm for SPNs that is computationally efficient, easy to implement and at the same time allows us to incorporate prior information into the optimization formulation. Extensive experiments show a significant improvement in accuracy compared with a maximum likelihood based approach.},

There is a large accuracy gap between today's publicly available face recognition systems and the state-of-the-art private face recognition systems. This paper presents our OpenFace face recognition library that bridges this accuracy gap. We show that OpenFace provides near-human accuracy on the LFW benchmark and present a new classification benchmark for mobile scenarios. This paper is intended for non-experts interested in using OpenFace and provides a light introduction to the deep neural network techniques we use. We released OpenFace in October 2015 as an open source library under the Apache 2.0 license. It is available at: <http://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/>},

We focus specifically on computational offloading as a cloud service. Using a wide range of applications, and exploring both pre-partitioned and dynamically partitioned approaches, we demonstrate the importance of low latency for cloud offload services. We show the best performance is achieved by offloading to cloudlets, which are small-scale edge-located data centers. Our results show that cloudlets can improve response times 51\% and reduce energy consumption in a mobile device by up to 42\% compared to cloud offload.},

We propose VM handoff as a technique for seamlessly transferring VM-encapsulated execution to a more optimal offload site as users move. Our approach can perform handoff in roughly a minute even over limited WANs by adaptively reducing data transferred. We present experimental results to validate our implementation and to demonstrate effectiveness of adaptation to changing network conditions and processing capacity},
